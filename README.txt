description:

There were a captcha generation tool and a model in tensorflow at https://github.com/JackonYang/captcha-tensorflow. But it hasn't been updated for a while, some of the code in it has been depreciated.
I have implemented a pytorch version of a simple cnn model and a easy to use interface. I borrowed the captcha generation tool from the above link and slightly modify it.

usage:

**generate captcha:
g


**train model:
e

**predict captcha:

*command line:
